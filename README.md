# Gravity Simulation in MPI
In this project I used MPI library to simulate the gravitational forces between objects in parallel. This was my homework
for the Parallel Programming course taught at Technical University of Munich. Please take a look at the [project description](https://github.com/burakcuhadar/Gravity-Simulation-in-MPI/blob/master/Description.pdf)
for the details. The code I wrote by myself is in the student folder. 

Compilation and running instructions are explained in the [project description](https://github.com/burakcuhadar/Gravity-Simulation-in-MPI/blob/master/Description.pdf).
